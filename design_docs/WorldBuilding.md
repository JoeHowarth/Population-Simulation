### World Building Module 

#### Purpose
This module should take a series of map files produced by the *Terrain Generator* as input and 
construct a full initial state that the *Simulation Engine* can process. The map files 
should contain spatial data on terrain, geology, water systems and biomes. While some of these
factors may eventually be simulated on the game's timescale, most don't change rapidly enough
to justify the initial complexity and will likely initially be static.
